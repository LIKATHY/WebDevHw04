README:

For log in :
User are able to type in their email into the log in bar.
Once they hit log in, they are able to see their username instead of the log in bar.
Once logged in they will also be able to see posts and be able to write new posts.
Note: users will not be able to create posts unless they are logged in.

For post:
Users are able to create posts by clicking on the Posts in the nav bar and then clicking on New Post link.
Once clicked, users are able to see the new post link where they will fill in the title and content of the post.
Once the user submits the post it appears on the Listing Posts. 

For Follow:
Users should be able to follow users by clicking a follow button next to each user's username/name/password.

App supports log in and posts (with user requirements and tracking) but does not support follow.

App probably does not survive VPS reboot.
